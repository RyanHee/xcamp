Description：

     The famous Hanoi tower problem:

     There are three sticks A，B，C. There are N disks on stick A (N>1). The sizes of the disks decrease from bottom to the top. Please move all the disks to stick B according to the following rules.

1. Move only one disk at a time.

2. The bigger disk can't lay on the smaller disk.

     You can use the following strategy to solve the problem:

     Suppose we have to move t disks from stick x to stick y, we can first move the upper t-1 disks to another stick, then put the biggest disk to y, and finally move that t-1 disks to stick y. Therefore, moving that t-1 disks becomes a sub-problem.

     Given n, please output the process of operation in the right order according to the above strategy.

 

Input：

a positive integer n

 

Output：

Several lines, representing the process of operation.

See sample for format.
