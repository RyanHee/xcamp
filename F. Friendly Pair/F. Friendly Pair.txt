We define two numbers as friendly if and only if they are adjacent to each other and have the same value.

 

Input
The first line contains two integers n, m representing the matrix size. 
(1≤n,m≤500)

Then n lines, m integers per line, each integer between 0 and 100.


Output
The number of friendly pairs.
