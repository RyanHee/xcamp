# Description
Given an n∗m matrix, find the number of friendly pairs in this matrix.<br>

We define two numbers as friendly if and only if they are adjacent to each other and have the same value.<br>

 

# Input
The first line contains two integers n, m representing the matrix size. (1≤n,m≤500)<br>

Then n lines, m integers per line, each integer between 0 and 100.


# Output
The number of friendly pairs.

 

# Sample Input
5 4<br>
3 3 3 4<br>
2 0 0 3<br>
0 3 1 4<br>
3 4 3 3<br>
1 0 3 3<br>
# Sample Output
